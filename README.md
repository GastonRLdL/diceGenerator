# üé≤ diceGenerator

A dynamic and interactive frontend project that allows you to create and roll custom dice with various functionalities. Perfect for your board games, role-playing sessions, or simply for experimenting with random number generation!

## üåü Features

* **Variable Number of Faces:** Easily define how many faces your die will have (e.g., d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100, or any custom count!).
* **Standard Mode (1-N):** A classic die that generates numerical results from 1 up to the specified number of faces.
* **Custom Mode:** Assign unique content to each face of your die. You can use text, numbers, or anything you can imagine (e.g., "Success", "Critical Fail", "Gold", "BOOM!").
* **Elimination Die Mode:** An advanced feature where once a result is rolled, that specific "face" is removed from the pool of possible outcomes for subsequent rolls. Ideal for unique game mechanics!
* **Minimalist (Terminal-Style) Interface:** Focused purely on functionality, with a dark background and bright green text aesthetic reminiscent of a classic code terminal.

## üöÄ How to Use and Run the Project

This project is designed to function as a modern web application. To access and use the Dice Generator:

#### Option 1: Access Directly on the Web (Recommended)

The latest version of the Dice Generator is hosted on GitHub Pages and is directly accessible from your web browser. **No local setup is required!**

* **Visit the web application here:** [https://gastonrldl.github.io/diceGenerator/](https://gastonrldl.github.io/diceGenerator/)

#### Option 2: "Install" as a Mobile App (PWA - Coming Soon)

This project is being developed as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, meaning you can "install" it directly from your browser on your mobile or desktop device, and it will function like a native app, even offline.

* **To install it (once PWA functionality is complete):**
    1.  Open the web application URL ([https://gastonrldl.github.io/diceGenerator/](https://gastonrldl.github.io/diceGenerator/)) in your mobile device's browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).
    2.  Look for the "Add to Home Screen" option or an install icon (often a `+` sign in a circle or a small computer screen with a downward arrow in the browser's URL bar).
    3.  Follow the instructions to install the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
* **CSS3:** To apply the minimalist terminal-like styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all the interactive logic of the dice, including face management, mode switching, and the rolling mechanism.
