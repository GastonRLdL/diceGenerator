# 🎲 diceGenerator

A dynamic and interactive frontend project that allows you to create and roll custom dice with various functionalities. Perfect for your board games, role-playing sessions, or simply for experimenting with random number generation!

## 🌟 Features

* **Variable Number of Faces:** Easily define how many faces your die will have (e.g., d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100, or any custom count!).
* **Standard Mode (1-N):** A classic die that generates numerical results from 1 up to the specified number of faces.
* **Custom Mode:** Assign unique content to each face of your die. You can use text, numbers, or anything you can imagine (e.g., "Success", "Critical Fail", "Gold", "BOOM!").
* **Elimination Die Mode:** An advanced feature where once a result is rolled, that specific "face" is removed from the pool of possible outcomes for subsequent rolls. Ideal for unique game mechanics!
* **Minimalist (Terminal-Style) Interface:** Focused purely on functionality, with a dark background and bright green text aesthetic reminiscent of a classic code terminal.
